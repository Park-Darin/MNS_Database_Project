# Monash New Smile (MNS) Database Project

## Introduction

This project involves the development and querying of a relational and non-relational database for Monash New Smile (MNS), a dental service provider. The project is divided into two main tasks: writing SQL queries to produce specified outputs and converting relational database data into a non-relational database structure using MongoDB.

## Project Overview

The project aims to apply advanced SQL and MongoDB operations to manage and query the MNS database, ensuring it meets user requirements. This includes creating and querying relational databases using SQL and implementing MongoDB operations for non-relational data management.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Relational Database Queries - SQL

- **Objective**: Write SQL queries to produce specified outputs using the Monash New Smile set of tables.
- **File**: `T2-mns-select.sql`
- **Details**: Includes queries to list items with specific stock levels, provider details, expensive services, and appointments with their total costs.

### Task 2: Non-Relational Database Queries - MongoDB

- **Objective**: Convert relational database data into a non-relational structure and perform MongoDB queries.
- **Files**: `T3-mns-json.sql`, `T3-mns-mongo.mongodb.js`
- **Details**: Create a JSON collection of appointment data, insert documents into MongoDB, and perform various MongoDB operations such as listing appointments and updating item descriptions.

## Usage

1. **Execute SQL Queries**: Use the provided `T2-mns-select.sql` file to run the SQL queries and produce the required outputs.
2. **MongoDB Operations**: Use the provided `T3-mns-mongo.mongodb.js` file to execute MongoDB operations, including inserting documents and querying the database.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of relational and non-relational database operations to manage and query the Monash New Smile database. By leveraging SQL and MongoDB, the project meets user requirements for data management and retrieval, ensuring efficient and accurate database operations.
